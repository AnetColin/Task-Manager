        <h1>Task Manager</h1><hr>
        <h3>A to-do list task manager is a system or tool,
         digital or physical, for organizing, prioritizing, and tracking
          tasks to be completed, ensuring nothing is forgotten and providing a clear plan for accomplishing goals. While a simple to-do list is a basic list of tasks, a task manager offers more functionality,
         such as subtasks, due dates, reminders, and collaboration features 
         to manage tasks more efficiently for personal or professional projects.
